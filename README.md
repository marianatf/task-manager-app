# Task Manager App

## Initial thinking

- Array of tasks with title, description and priority

## We want

- To create, view, complete and remove tasks

## Code thinking

- [x] Initialize project with Vite
- [x] Add linter for TS + React
- [x] Add Tailwind CSS
- [x] List all tasks
- [x] Click the task to show description
- [x] Ability to remove a task
- [x] Ability to complete a task
- [x] Ability to remove all completed tasks (footer)
- [x] Show number of pending tasks (footer)
- [x] Create task form (header)
- [x] Group the tasks by priority and order them
- [x] Persist tasks across web app with localStorage
- [x] Add testing env with Vitest and React Testing Library

## Reflections

1. Why use Tailwind CSS instead?
    
    Since styled Components went into maintenance-only mode last year, I opted for Tailwind CSS as it's actively maintained and its predefined classes could help speed up UI creation

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode
